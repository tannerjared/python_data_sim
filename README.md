# Data simulation in Python
This is a short script that generates 5 simulated variables for 300 cases. The first is called 'age'. The mean is set around 58, with the ranges between 45 - 85. These values can be changed in the code if needed. The other four variables (Var1 - Var4) also have means around 58 but correlate differently with age. All values and variable names can be modified as needed.

These data were created to set up analyses in R and then an actual dataset run through the code.
